# Network Parameters #
MODEL_TYPE: 'coil-icra' # The type of model. Defines which modules the model has.
MODEL_CONFIGURATION:  # Based on the MODEL_TYPE, we specify the structure
  perception:  # The module that process the image input, it ouput the number of classes
    res:
      name: 'resnet34'
      num_classes: 512

  measurements:  # The module the process the input float data, in this case speed_input
    fc:  # Easy to configure fully connected layer
      neurons: [128, 128] # Each position add a new layer with the specified number of neurons
      dropouts: [0.0, 0.0]
  join:  # The module that joins both the measurements and the perception
    fc:
      neurons: [512]
      dropouts: [0.0]
  speed_branch:  # The prediction branch speed branch
    fc:
      neurons: [256, 256]
      dropouts: [0.0, 0.5]
  branches:  # The output branches for the different possible directions ( Straight, Left, Right, None)
